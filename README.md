# Medical_Insurance_Cost_Prediction using Machine Learning with Python.

Project Overview: Developed a predictive model for estimating insurance charges using linear regression. Processed and analyzed a dataset of 1338 entries, encompassing demographic (age, sex, BMI, children) and categorical (smoker, region) factors.

Data Exploration: Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) including statistical measures and visualizations (histograms, count plots) to understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset.

Model Development: Implemented a Linear Regression model using Python's scikit-learn library to predict insurance charges based on demographic and lifestyle factors. Achieved a high accuracy with R-squared values of 0.75 on training data and 0.74 on test data.

Technical Skills: Demonstrated proficiency in Python programming for data manipulation (NumPy, Pandas), visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn), and machine learning (scikit-learn). Applied data preprocessing techniques such as categorical encoding and train-test splitting to ensure robust model performance.
